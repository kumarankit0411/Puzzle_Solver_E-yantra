ITS OUR HONOUR THAT WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS COMPETETION AND ARE ABLE TO REACH THIS FAR IN
YOUR GUIDANCE. THIS FILE IS MADE TO EASE YOUR WORK AS WE HAVE MENTIONED EACH STEP THAT WE TOOK TO 
IMPLEMENT THIS CODE ON THE BOT WHICH SOLVES THE THEME ASSIGNED TO US. WE HAVE TRIED OUR LEVEL BEST 
TO ENSURE THAT THE CODE IS READABLE AND UNDERSTANDEABLE BY EVERYONE AND I WANT TO GIVE ALL CREDIT
TO MY TEAM MEMBERS WITHOUT WHOM THIS PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE COMPLETED ON TIME.

FOLLOWING ARE THE STEPS WE FOLLOWED FOR SUCCESSFUL RUNNING OF THE CODE:-


1. OPEN EMBEDDED-C CODE AND LOAD THE HEX FILE NAMED "black_line_follower.hex" IN THE DEFAULTS FOLDER 
  ONTO THE ROBOT.

2. ONCE LOADED TURN OFF AND ON THE ROBOT.

3. NOW WHILE THE SERIAL CABLE IS CONNECTED RUN "image_processing.py" FROM PYTHON CODE FOLDER.

"*NOTE:- IMAGE CAN BE CHANGED IN MAIN FUNCTION OF THE PYTHON CODE"

4. DURING THE RUN OF PYTHON CODE,OUTPUT IS DISPLAYED AND LISTS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE BOT 
   SERIALLY  VIA "COM2" PORT IN OUR CASE.(PYSERIAL MODULE IS USED)

5. NOW REMOVE CABLE AND PRESS THE BOOT KEY WHILST THE ROBOT IS KEPT ON STARTING BLACK LINE.
     (CASTOR WHEEL IS ON THE THICK  START LINE)

6. ROBOT SHOULD SOLVE THE PUZZLE NOW.


ALSO WE SUBMITTED THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION VIDEO IN ONE SHOT  AND MERGED THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 
ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION WITH THE BONUS TASK IMPLEMENTATION. I HOPE THAT WONT CREATE ANY PROBLEM.
ALSO DURING THE SHOOT OF BONUS CONFIGURATION YOU MAY NOTICE VIBRATION SOUND TWO TIMES WHICH IS 
NOTHING BUT NOTIFICATION SOUND FROM THE MOBILE PHONE WE USED TO SHOOT  THE VIDEO. PLEASE PARDON US 
FOR THAT.
